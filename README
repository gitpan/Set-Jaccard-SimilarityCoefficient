    Calculate the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient.

NAME
    Set::Jaccard::SimilarityCoefficient - Calculate the Jaccard Similarity
    Coefficient of 2 sets

VERSION
    # VERSION

SYNOPSIS
    $res = Set::Jaccard::SimilarityCoefficient::calc(\@set_a, \@set_b);

    OR

    my $a = Set::Scalar->new(@set_a); my $b = Set::Scalar->new(@set_b); $res
    = Set::Jaccard::SimilarityCoefficient::calc($a, $b);

DESCRIPTION
    Set::Jaccard::SimilarityCoefficient lets you calculate the Jaccard
    Similarity Coefficient for either arrayrefs or Set::Scalar objects.

    Briefly, the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient is a simple measure of how
    similar 2 sets are. The calculation is (in pseudo-code):

            count(difference(SET-A, SET-B)) / count(union(SET-A, SET-B))

    There is a Jaccard Similarity Coefficient routine already in CPAN, but
    it is specialized for use by Text::NSP. I wanted a generic routine that
    could be used by anyone so Set::Jaccard::SimilarityCoefficient was born.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
    calc(A, B) calculates the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient for the
    arguments A and B. A and B can be either array references or Set::Scalar
    objects.

DIAGNOSTICS
    new() will complain if A or B is empty, not either a reference to an
    array, or not a Set::Scalar object.

    calc() could theoretically throw DivideByZeroException when the union of
    the two sets has 0 members. However, that would require set A or set B
    to have 0 members, which was previously prohibited by the prohibition on
    empty sets.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    This module should work wherever Perl works.

DEPENDENCIES
    Set::Scalar

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    None that I know of.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    There are no bugs that I know of. Given that this is non-trivial code,
    there will be bugs.

    The types of arguments are limited to either array references or
    Set::Scalar objects.
